## Why should we test our code?

<Steps>

- To verify that it meets the **requirements**
- To avoid **regressions** after refactoring
- As a **documentation**
- To have a way to test specific cases that are difficult to test manually
- As a **guidance** that
    - force us to think about all cases
    - tells us when we can stop developing a feature

</Steps>
