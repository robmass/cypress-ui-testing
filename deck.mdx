## Why should we test our code?

<Steps>

- To verify that it meets the **requirements**
- To avoid **regressions** after refactoring
- As a **documentation**
- To have a way to test specific cases that are difficult to test manually
- As a **guidance** that
    - force us to think about all cases
    - tells us when we can stop developing a feature

</Steps>

## Why aren't we testing our code?

<Steps>

- Writing good tests is **hard**
- We think that testing manually is enough and faster than writing automatic tests
- We think that writing tests is **expensive**

</Steps>

## Test Desiderata (1/2)

- **Isolated** — tests should return the same results regardless of the order in which they are run.
- **Composable** — if tests are isolated, then I can run 1 or 10 or 100 or 1,000,000 and get the same results.
- **Behavioral** — tests should be sensitive to changes in the behavior of the code under test. If the behavior changes, the test result should change.
- **Structure-insensitive** — tests should not change their result if the structure of the code changes.
- **Deterministic** — if nothing changes, the test result shouldn’t change.
- **Specific** — if a test fails, the cause of the failure should be obvious.

## Test Desiderata (2/2)

- **Fast** — tests should run quickly.
- **Writable** — tests should be cheap to write relative to the cost of the code being tested.
- **Readable** — tests should be comprehensible for reader, invoking the motivation for writing this particular test.
- **Automated** — tests should run without human intervention.
- **Predictive** — if the tests all pass, then the code under test should be suitable for production.
- **Inspiring** — passing the tests should inspire confidence
